## 1. Score Distribution

The distribution of the final credit scores (0-1000) across all unique wallets highlights the model's effective segmentation of user behavior.

*(Briefly describe the observation, e.g., "The distribution shows clear peaks at the lower (0-200) and upper (801-1000) ends of the spectrum, with a sparser middle range, indicating the model's ability to distinctly categorize high-risk and high-reliability wallets.")*

## 2. Key Feature Importances

The Random Forest model identifies which engineered features were most crucial in determining a wallet's credit score.

**Key Insights from Feature Importance:**
* **`deposit_to_redeem_ratio`**: Overwhelmingly the most important feature (approx. [FILL VALUE]%), indicating that a wallet's consistency in providing liquidity versus withdrawing it is paramount.
* **`repay_to_borrow_ratio`**: The second most critical factor (approx. [FILL VALUE]%), highlighting responsible debt management.
* **`net_flow_usd`**: (approx. [FILL VALUE]%) Represents the overall financial contribution, acting as a strong signal for protocol health.
* **`num_liquidation_calls` / `has_been_liquidated`**: These are critical negative indicators, even with relatively smaller percentage importances, as their presence significantly impacts the score.

## 3. Behavioral Insights by Score Range

Examining wallets categorized by their credit score reveals distinct behavioral patterns.

**(INSERT BOX/BAR PLOTS FOR KEY FEATURES VS. SCORE CATEGORY HERE)**
*(Consider including 2-3 key plots, e.g., one for `num_liquidation_calls` and one for `deposit_to_redeem_ratio` against score categories, as discussed previously.)*

### High-Score Wallets (801-1000)
These wallets are the most reliable users. They typically exhibit:
* **Zero or very few `num_liquidation_calls`**.
* **High `deposit_to_redeem_ratio`** (average: [FILL AVG VALUE]), showing long-term liquidity provision.
* **High `repay_to_borrow_ratio`** (average: [FILL AVG VALUE]), indicating excellent debt repayment.
* **Positive `net_flow_usd`** (average: [FILL AVG VALUE] USD), meaning they are net contributors to the protocol.
* Tend to have longer engagement (`days_active`).

### Low-Score Wallets (0-200)
These wallets are identified as high-risk or potentially problematic. They frequently show:
* **One or more `liquidationcall` events**.
* **Low `repay_to_borrow_ratio`** (average: [FILL AVG VALUE]), often indicating failed repayments.
* **Low `deposit_to_redeem_ratio`** (average: [FILL AVG VALUE]) or high `borrow_to_deposit_ratio_overall`.
* **Negative `net_flow_usd`** (average: [FILL AVG VALUE] USD), signifying net extraction or losses.
* Often associated with high leverage.

## 4. Conclusion

The Random Forest Regressor effectively assigns credit scores based on DeFi transaction behavior. Its high accuracy (Test R-squared: 0.9714) and strong interpretability via feature importances make it a robust tool for assessing wallet reliability. The model highlights that a wallet's capital stability and diligent debt repayment are paramount indicators of creditworthiness within Aave V2. This framework provides a valuable basis for risk management and reputation systems in the decentralized finance landscape.
